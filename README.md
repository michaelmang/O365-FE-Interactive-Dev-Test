# O365 Front-End Interactive Dev Test

## Instructions
This repo contains a React application that allows you to convert currency exchange rates by utilizing the [exchange rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/). This application currently meets all of the following functional requirements:
  - The user can choose a base currency and target currency. The currency choices are currently hardcoded in the UI
  code.
  - The user can also choose a date (to get the exchange rate for that particular date).
  - When the user submits the form, it looks up the exchange rate and displays the result.
  - The exchange rate information is retrieved from the API.
  - The application handles a basic experience around API exceptions and unexpected error status, as well as invalid form inputs.
  - The website runs in the latest version of Chrome and Firefox.

Please familiarize yourself with this code. During the interactive dev test, you will be tasked with extending a feature to this application. While prior absorbtion of the code is expected, there will be time during the session to ask questions.

## Running the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Before running the app for the first time, remember to run `npm install` to pull in dependencies

### `npm start`
